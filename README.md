Construction of a spark chamber
==========

This document describes the construction of a spark chamber detector
for educational purposes.


What is a spark chamber
-----------------------

A spark chamber
([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_chamber)) is a
particle detector. It allows to detect and visualize subatomic
particles that costitute all the matter that surround us (including
ourselves!). In some way, a spark chamber is the ancestor of the
particle detectors that, for example, were used at the Large Hadron
Collider to discover the Higgs boson.

What are the cosmic rays
------------------------

The particles that one can visualize with a spark chamber are
fundamental particles. We call them *fundamental* because we believe
that they cannot be broken down into smaller pieces. They are so small
that we usually do not see them in our everyday life, because we only
see the bigger objects in which they aggregate, such as atoms and
molecules. However, sometimes these particles can have very large
speed, and they can travel lonely, without aggregating into atoms.
For example, the particles produced in the stars in outer space, can
travel at relativistic speeds until they reach us. We call them cosmic
rays ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray)), and they
continuosly hit our planet. In fact, if you keep your hand horizontal,
every second there are a few cosmic rays going through it.

The goal of this project is to build a spark chamber to visualize
these cosmic rays, to learn how we can detect these particles, and to
learn about particle physics.
