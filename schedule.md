## Quarter 1
- **Week 1** : review existing literature on the detector and on the
  electronics.
- **Week 2** : design the chamber and the plates; order the parts for
  the chamber. Machine shop training.
- **Week 3** : design the gas and electrical connections; order the
    parts.
- **Week 4** : review the existing designs for the trigger circuit and
  for the high-voltage (HV) pulse generator.
- **Week 5** : fix scintillators and photomultipliers (PMT). Generate
  test trigger with VME modules
- **Week 6-7** : design pre-amplifier (for PMT) and discriminator
  circuits. Order components. Order FPGA.
- **Week 8-9-10** : build pre-amplifier and discriminator. Interface
  their output with the FPGA.

## Quarter 2
- **Week 1-2** : design the HV pulse generator circuit using the spark
  plug. Order components.
- **Week 2-3** : design the thyristor-driver circuit. Order
    components.
- **Week 4** : interface FPGA output with the thyristor driver.
- **Week 5** : machine work: chamber and plates. Order gas.
- **Week 6** : verify that the chamber is air tight. Fix leaks.
- **Week 7** : debug the trigger system; optimize the configurable
  trigger parameters.
- **Week 8-9** : debug complete setup (chamber+trigger+HV). Optimize
    efficiency vs. gas purity.
- **Week 10** : measure the time-of-arrival distribution. Finalize
  reports.
